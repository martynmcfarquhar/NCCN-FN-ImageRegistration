# Summary
Despite the seemingly simple problem of getting two images to line-up with one another, image registration is quite a complicated topic. However, because image registration is fundamental to many of the processing steps used for fMRI data analysis, understanding how this works now will be of great benefit later on the course. This is one of the processing steps that we have to keep a close eye on to make sure the computer is doing a good job, hence why we have spent so long discussing it. As such, make sure you have a good sense of what registration is, the difference between performing registration in world-space and voxel-space, and have had a go at doing it yourself in `SPM`. We will see how these principles are applied in the context of an fMRI data analysis a little later in the course.
