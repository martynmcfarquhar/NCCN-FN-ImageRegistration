We can then multiply voxel coordinates by $\\mathbf{M}$ and get the corresponding millimetre coordinates, as well as multiply millimetre coordinates by $\\mathbf{M}^{-1}$ and get the corresponding voxel coordinates.\n",

This information is stored in the *metadata* of the file, which is simply all the information carried within the file in addition to the voxel values. On this course, we will be mostly using the `NIfTI` format for brain images, which contains a voxel-to-world mapping matrix within its *header* information. Practically, this means that any `NIfTI`-formatted image carries with it the $\\mathbf{M}$ matrix needed to convert voxel coordinates into millimetre coordinates.\n",
